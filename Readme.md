This **`GitHub`** repository hosts a collection of **`Bash`**. scripts. These scripts provide solutions for two main scenarios:

- **Compression and Loading of Log Files into S3**: These scripts enable the compression of log files and their subsequent transfer and storage in an S3 service. This streamlines the efficient management and storage of logs, which is crucial in server and web application environments.

- **Matching Patterns in Large Files Using Regular Expressions**: These scripts are designed to search for specific patterns and matches within large files using regular expressions. This is useful for identifying critical information or errors in extensive logs.

To access each of these scripts, you need to navigate through the different branches of the project. Each branch represents a specific set of scripts related to a particular task. The branch organization allows for easy selection and access to the required functionality based on the use case.
